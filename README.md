This is an interactive map with Leaflet of death rates from heart disease by county in the United States in 2014

My Shiny web app, Cardiovascular Disease Explorer, filters through the Heart Disease Mortality Dataset from 2013 to 2015 provided by the CDC.  Code is available thorugh server.R and ui.R on this repository.  The application takes about 2 minutes to load, more work needs to be done to improve the efficiency.
